## Module 2 Challenge Files

The files uploaded are
- Screenshots of results by year (.png)
- VBA script file (.vb)

In this challenge, I've created a VBA script that loops through each sheet in the given Mulitple Year Stock Data excel sheet to output the following data
  - The ticker symbol
  - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The total stock volume of the stock.

For ease of review, the following are screenshots of the results for each year,
